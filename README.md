Todo List - Webserv 

	
- determine the main classes or structs we’ll need throughout the project
- determine how we’ll divide the work	
- have a basic http request working (without a configuration file yet)
- understand how configuration files work (Mostafa) and need to be parsed
- understand how to listen on all clients and ports with select(), poll(0 or epoll() (Victoire)
- understand how CGI works and is used (Victoire)
- how to parse the http request (Alisa)


We can have someone working on :
- socket's class creation (cf video)
- understanding the request and define the response
- creating the response

1 - client and server info
2 - response and request
3 - configuration file and parsing
