/*
# Configuration Fileâ€™s Structure
nginx consists of modules which are controlled by directives specified 
in the configuration file. Directives are divided into simple directives 
and block directives. A simple directive consists of the name and 
parameters separated by spaces and ends with a semicolon (;). 
A block directive has the same structure as a simple directive, 
but instead of the semicolon it ends with a set of additional 
instructions surrounded by braces ({ and }). If a block directive can 
have other directives inside braces, it is called a 
context (examples: server or location).

The rest of a line after the # sign is considered a comment.
